To create a CMakeLists.txt file for this project, you can use the following lines:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(filepattern)

find_package(pybind11 REQUIRED)
pybind11_add_module(filepattern filepattern.cpp)

target_link_libraries(filepattern PRIVATE pybind11::embed)
```

This CMakeLists.txt file sets up a minimal CMake project for your pybind11 module. It searches for the Pybind11 package (which needs to be installed on your system), adds your module as a target, and links it against the Pybind11 library.
